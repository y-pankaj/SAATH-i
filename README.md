## Problem
During times of calamity there are several individual/group around the globe who are willing to extend a helping hand in form of services, monetary help or donations but don't know how to do it.This may lead to decrease in motivation of such people due to lack of support and direction. There are situations where some people have resources and others have time, but none of them is able to contribute due lack of time and resource respectively.
Families living far and near find if difficult to locate their loved ones during the times of calamity.
The reason for loss of life and resources during natural disaster is high due to lack of timely information and precautions.

## Our Solution
We aim to build a website that would solve the above mentioned problems. Our main aim is to provide better communication between people for different places of world who are willing to help for a cause.For this we have planned to make chat room for every natural calamity that has occured.Here many people can come together to pool resources.Also people with similar goal can come together to effectively cause a change.This would ensure a better co-ordination and communication between such people.
Also we aim to provide a platform for easy donation of items during calamity by maintaining an inventory of them and providing it to the people via website.
Photos location and details(if possible) of rescued people will be uploaded in our "missing people" section.
